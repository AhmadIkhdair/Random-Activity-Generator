# Random Activity Generator

## Description

This is a small challenge to practice the use of API's. Bored API by the App Brewery is used to generate a random activity everytime a request is made.

You can filter the activity using the form, which then makes a get request to the specified endpoint and parameters.

This challenge's main focus was to practice the use of Axios, for making server-side API requests.
